Images: Is there a logo, photos, icons or illustrations that can be used from the original site?
Almost images are from the real source as it is personal business site. More relevant images would be from its own source like the images of physiotherapists and the brand logo, as it is unique and the place is also unique which can not be replaced.  

Fonts: Are there any brand typefaces that you can reuse? List 2 font-families that you plan to use in your redesign (one for headlines and one for body copy)
I did not like the font style of this page actually it is very simple so font family is applied.
I would like to use Open Sans for the body and Poppins for the headlins.
