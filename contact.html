          <h3>Jared Hromika MPT, FDN/IMS</h3>
          <div class="therpist">
          <img src="Images/third.jpg" alt="Jared" width="200" />
          <p>
            Jared graduated from the University of British Columbia in 2014 with
            a Masters of Physical Therapy and moved to the Comox Valley with his
            wife in the summer of 2015. Before moving to the valley, he worked
            in Vancouver at several locum positions in private practice
            orthopaedics in order to gain exposure to different patient
            populations and approaches to treatment. This experience has helped
            Jared consider movement problems from different perspectives while
            providing a framework for his post graduate development. Jared's
            approach to treatment involves movement assessment, manual therapy
            techniques, and exercise prescription in order to help you move more
            effectively and with less pain. He also has additional training with
            Neurokinetic Therapy, which is a method of assessment and treatment
            for compensation patterns that have developed over the years and
            often go unnoticed. This helps direct treatment towards the cause of
            your symptoms and improve your overall quality of movement. In
            addition to physiotherapy treatment, Jared is excited to provide
            Ascent Physiotherapy with bike fitting services. He was introduced
            to triathlon in 2006 and has enjoyed working on his bikes ever
            since. While enrolled in the masters program at UBC, he completed
            additional training through the BC Division of Sport Physiotherapy
            Canada for rider assessment and bike fit to optimize a rider's
            efficiency and comfort in the saddle. When he's not in the clinic or
            on his bike, Jared enjoys many activities including swimming, trail
            running, softball and hockey
